# ingenium_lidar_main_system_jazzy

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This repository contains bash scripts and config files for installing all relevant tools and gathering and processing data for the Wheaton College Tel Shimron lidar project. This branch is built on ROS2 Jazzy Jalisco. As of this writing (June 2026) this branch is NOT complete, and NOT functional.

## Installation Instructions

0. Select the variant of this package that you want to install.

    The valid arguments are: 

    - `--dev-jazzy`
    - `--rpi`
    - `--sl`
    - `--help`

    The `--help` option provides more information about the different options. 

    `--dev-jazzy` is intended for use on the Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS Desktop developer laptop for a LiDAR project. 

    `--rpi` is intended for use on an Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS Server installation on a Raspberry Pi 3. It exclusively installs the dependencies and packages needed for recording data from the LiDAR puck and IMU. 

    For more details on `--sl`, see the help menu.

    Ommitting a parameter or submitting an invalid parameter is the same as calling `--help`. 


1. Once you have decided which variant you would like to run, insert the relevant argument into the following template:

    `bash <(curl -L tinyurl.com/ingenium-lidar-installer-jazzy) [arg]`

    For example, to print the help menu without installing anything, I would run

    `bash <(curl -L tinyurl.com/ingenium-lidar-installer-jazzy) --help` in terminal.

    To install the ROS Jazzy-flavored development environment, I would run 

    `bash <(curl -L tinyurl.com/ingenium-lidar-installer-jazzy) --dev-jazzy`

## Alternative Installation Instructions

If you'd rather not run a random bash script straight off the web, you can use this method to download and inspect the relevant file before you run it. 

0. Use wget to download `install.sh` from the internet. We provide a tinyurl link to simplify this process. The appropriate command is

    `wget -O install.sh https://tinyurl.com/ingenium-lidar-installer-jazzy`

1. Mark the downloaded script as executable by running `chmod +x install.sh`

2. Run the script with the appropriate argument to install a particular set of software packages from this repository. The valid arguments are explained above.

    To set up the dev-jazzy system, you would run

    `./install.sh --dev-jazzy`
    
    These scripts frequently prompt sudo at various stages of the process. This is normal.

## Instructions for Gathering and Processing Data

0. Connect your LiDAR Hardware (this is tested with a Velodyne VLP-32C Ultra Puck) and IMU (this is tested with a LORD Microstrain 3DM-GX5-15/3DM-GX5-AR) to the data gathering device. Run `./record_to_bag.sh`. This should procduce a .mcap file in `~/Documents/Data`

    - Optionally, you may include a parameter: `./record_to_bag.sh [Location_Identifier]` where `[Location_Identifier]` is an arbitrary string that will help you remember where you took your data. If you do not use this parameter, the script will prompt you for a "Grid ID", which is the same thing. This identifier will be included in your file path.

1. On the fastest available computer, run `./process_bag.sh /path/to/your/mcap/file.mcap`. 

    [!NOTE] The dependencies for this script are not included in the minimal installation for Raspberry Pi!

    [!WARNING] this script is not yet functional!

## Instructions for Downloading a Single File from GitHub with the Command Line

1. On the GitHub website, navigate to the file you want to download and open the preview

2. On the upper right of the page, select "Raw" and copy the URL

3. On your device, run

`wget -O [new_file_name] https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[my_user_name]/[my_repository]/refs/heads/[my_branch]/[name_of_my_file]`

For example, to download `RPi_Default_Apps_Installer.sh`, run:

`wget -O RPi_Default_Apps_Installer.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ingenium-lidar/ingenium_lidar_main_system_jazzy/refs/heads/main/RPi_Default_Apps_Installer.sh`
